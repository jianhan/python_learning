# For prediction of the response variable here, we will learn a Lasso model. A Lasso model is an extension
# of the normal linear regression model which allows us to apply L1 regularization to the model. Simply put, a
# lasso regression will try to minimize the number of independent variables in the final model. This will give
# us the model with the most important variables only (feature selection)
